# homeassistant_projects
Separate Home Assistant scripts, automations and best practices to share with the world 

##  Intro
I'm not a programmer. I'm just a home automation enthiousiast. And kind of lazy, that's why I try to make my life as easy as possible usning clever Home Assistant applications. 
A lot of the work I create in home assistant is too specific, but sometimes I develop stuff which I believe might be of interest to other users. 

I'll be sharing those here, with a tutorial of the use cases I see and how to implement them in your own life.
